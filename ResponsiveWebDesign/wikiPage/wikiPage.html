                C programming language
            </header>
            <article>
                <p>The C programming language is an imperative procedural language which was designed to be compiled to provide low-level access to memory and to provide an efficient language for instructing machines. Even though it's a low-level language, it was developed to stimulate cross-platform programming.</p>
                <p>C is widely used for systems programming in implementing operating systems and embedded system applications. It's sometimes used as an intermediate language by implementations of other languages to take advantage of the portability and convenience of the C language characteristics.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Data typing is static but weakly enforced;</li>
                    <li>Function return values can be ignored when not needed;</li>
                    <li>Low-level computer memory access is possible;</li>
                </ul>
                <p>An example of the C programming language structure can be seen bellow. The first is a "Hello world", while the second shows the allocation of a two-dimensional array on the heap and the use of multi-dimensional array indexing for accesses.</p>
                <code><xmp>#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    printf("hello, world\n");
}</xmp></code>
                <code><xmp>int func(int N, int M)
{
    float (*p)[N][M] = malloc(sizeof *p);
    if (!p)
    return -1;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    for (int j = 0; j < M; j++)
        (*p)[i][j] = i + j;
    print_array(N, M, p);
    free(p);
    return 1;
}</xmp></code>
                <p>C has been widely used for implementing end-user applications, however, they can also be written in newer, higher level languages.</p>

                <p>P is a general-purpose scripting language geared towards web development     that is especially suited to server-side web development, in which case PHP generally runs on a web server. Originally designed to create dynamic web pages, PHP now focuses mainly on server-side scripting.</p>
                <p>You can see an example of PHP programming bellow:</p>
                <code><xmp><!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>PHP "Hello, World!" program</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <?php
            echo '<p>Hello, World!</p>';
        ?>
    </body>
</html></xmp></code>
<code><xmp>function myAge(int $birthYear): string
{
    // calculate the age by subtracting the birth year from the current year.
    $yearsOld = date('Y') - $birthYear;

    // return the age in a descriptive string.
    return $yearsOld . ' year' . ($yearsOld != 1 ? 's':'');
}

echo 'I am currently ' . myAge(1995) . ' old.';</xmp></code>
                <p>The standard PHP evolved without a written formal specification or standard until 2014. W3Techs reports that, as of January 2022, "PHP is used by 78.1% of all the websites whose server-side programming language we know. </p>

                <p>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. Is is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that complied Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.</p>
                <p>ava is used in applications, business, client-side, general-purpose, mobile development, server-side and web development.</p>
                <p>The language was created with the following primary goals:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>It must be simple, object-oriented, and familiar;</li>
                    <li>It must be robust and secure;</li>
                    <li>It must be architecture-neutral and portable;</li>
                    <li>It must execute with high performance;</li>
                    <li> must be interpreted, threaded and dynamic.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Some code written in Java can be seen bellow.</p>
                <code><xmp>public class HelloWorldApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!"); // Prints the string to the console.
    }
}</xmp></code>
